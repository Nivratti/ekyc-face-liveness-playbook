# 5.1 ISO/IEC 30107 Series

---

## Overview

ISO/IEC 30107 is the **international standard series** for biometric Presentation Attack Detection. It provides the terminology, testing methodology, and reporting framework that underpins all PAD certifications.

## The Four Parts

| Part | Title | Purpose | Key Content |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **30107-1** | Framework | Definitions and conceptual framework | PAI taxonomy, attack categories, PAD mechanism types |
| **30107-2** | Data Formats | Reporting format for PAD results | Standardized result reporting, APCER/BPCER per species |
| **30107-3** | Testing & Reporting | Testing methodology | How to test PAD systems, statistical requirements, test protocols |
| **30107-4** | Mobile Profile | Mobile-specific requirements | Addresses device diversity, environmental variability, mobile-specific attacks |

## Key Metrics Defined

**APCER** (Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate):
$$APCER_{PAI} = \frac{\text{Number of attack presentations incorrectly classified as bona fide}}{\text{Total attack presentations of that PAI species}}$$

**BPCER** (Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate):
$$BPCER = \frac{\text{Number of bona fide presentations incorrectly classified as attacks}}{\text{Total bona fide presentations}}$$

!!! danger "Critical: APCER Is Per Species"
    APCER must be reported **separately for each PAI species**. A system that blocks 100% of printed photos but misses 50% of screen replays would have APCER=0% for prints and APCER=50% for screens. Both must be reported.

## How Banks Should Use ISO 30107

1. **Require ISO 30107-3 compliant testing** in all vendor RFPs
2. **Request per-species APCER reports** — not just aggregate numbers
3. **Verify testing was performed by an accredited lab** (iBeta, BioLab, etc.)
4. **Map PAI species to your threat model** — which attacks are most relevant to your deployment?
5. **Reference 30107 in regulatory filings** as evidence of standards compliance
